| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3pts   | Clear Explanation of How Music Recommendation Systems Work | Student provides a short explanation of how real-world recommenders (Spotify, YouTube, etc.) use data features (genre, mood, tempo, user history).  |
|        |                                                            | Explanation correctly distinguishes between input data, user preferences, and ranking/selection.                                                    |
|        |                                                            | Explanation is specific, coherent, and consistent with basic ML literacy concepts (not generic or incorrect).                                       |
| 3pts   | Creation of a Structured Song Dataset                      | A dataset of at least 15-20 songs is created, either as a list of dicts, list of objects, or loaded from a CSV.                                     |
|        |                                                            | Each song includes at least 3 meaningful attributes (e.g., genre, mood, energy, tempo, era).                                                        |
|        |                                                            | Dataset is valid and loads/runs without errors.                                                                                                     |
| 3pts   | Scoring Function Accurately Reflects User Preferences      | A clear scoring function (e.g., `score_song(user_prefs, song)`) is implemented using weighting, matching, or similarity logic.                      |
|        |                                                            | Scoring logic works for all songs and returns consistent numeric output.                                                                            |
|        |                                                            | Scoring reflects the designed features (e.g., if preferences emphasize "high energy," scoring actually incorporates energy).                        |
| 3pts   | Recommendation Function Produces a Sorted List of Songs    | A function like `recommend_songs(user_prefs, songs)` is implemented that ranks or sorts songs by score.                                             |
|        |                                                            | Output includes at least top 3 recommendations.                                                                                                     |
|        |                                                            | Function runs without errors and works for different user profiles.                                                                                 |
| 3pts   | Explanations Are Provided for Recommended Songs            | Each recommended song includes a short explanation of why it was selected (e.g., "high energy + matching genre").                                   |
|        |                                                            | Explanations accurately reflect the scoring function (not generic statements) and appear as text in the README or model_card.md.                    |
|        |                                                            | At least three explanations are provided, are clear and readable, and appear as text in the README or model_card.md.                                |
| 3pts   | Experiments with Multiple User Profiles                    | At least three distinct user profiles are created (e.g., hip-hop fan, acoustic low-energy listener, high-tempo EDM listener).                       |
|        |                                                            | The recommender is run for each profile and outputs are presented as text in code blocks in the README or model_card.md.                            |
|        |                                                            | Student comments on differences between outputs (e.g., "EDM profile prefers high energy songs; acoustic profile shifts toward low energy guitars"). |
| 3pts   | Completed Model Card                                       | Model card includes a description of dataset, attributes used, and intended purpose.                                                                |
|        |                                                            | Model card includes an explanation of the algorithmic approach in plain language.                                                                   |
|        |                                                            | Model card identifies limitations/biases (e.g., genre imbalance, small dataset, popularity bias) and at least one improvement idea.                 |
